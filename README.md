# Taskify
To-Do application made for the course of Laboratorio di Programmazione at my university.

This application allows the user to create To-Do lists, save them as XML files and reopen them later. Each To-Do is reffered to as "Task", hence the name "Taskify".
Each task can be marked as Done and this status will be saved in the file so it will be the same when reopening the file.
When creating a Task the user can specify a simple Title and a Description for easy organization.

## External libraries
The GUI of this program has been created with the help of the wxWidgets library for C++.
Also the GTest framework has been used to implement unit tests.
